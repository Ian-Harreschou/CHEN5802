abstract = {We introduce physics-informed neural networks – neural networks that are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while respecting any given laws of physics described by general nonlinear partial differential equations. In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.}

abstract = {DScribe is a software package for machine learning that provides popular feature transformations (“descriptors”) for atomistic materials simulations. DScribe accelerates the application of machine learning for atomistic property prediction by providing user-friendly, off-the-shelf descriptor implementations. The package currently contains implementations for Coulomb matrix, Ewald sum matrix, sine matrix, Many-body Tensor Representation (MBTR), Atom-centered Symmetry Function (ACSF) and Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP). Usage of the package is illustrated for two different applications: formation energy prediction for solids and ionic charge prediction for atoms in organic molecules. The package is freely available under the open-source Apache License 2.0.
Program summary
Program Title: DScribe Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/vzrs8n8pk6.1 Licensing provisions: Apache-2.0 Programming language: Python/C/C++ Supplementary material: Supplementary Information as PDF Nature of problem: The application of machine learning for materials science is hindered by the lack of consistent software implementations for feature transformations. These feature transformations, also called descriptors, are a key step in building machine learning models for property prediction in materials science. Solution method: We have developed a library for creating common descriptors used in machine learning applied to materials science. We provide an implementation the following descriptors: Coulomb matrix, Ewald sum matrix, sine matrix, Many-body Tensor Representation (MBTR), Atom-centered Symmetry Functions (ACSF) and Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP). The library has a python interface with computationally intensive routines written in C or C++. The source code, tutorials and documentation are provided online. A continuous integration mechanism is set up to automatically run a series of regression tests and check code coverage when the codebase is updated.}
